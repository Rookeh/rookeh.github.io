# What's all this?

## tl;dr:
 These are privacy policies for some super old (and no longer available) apps, which were created to pacify automated nag emails I was getting from Google Play.

## Tell me more!
I have some very, very old and unpublished apps that were once available on the Google Play store. 

Once upon a time they were intended to help people navigate the [London Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground).

An earlier version just used some basic API calls to Transport for London to show the current service status.

A newer version of the app, rebuilt from scratch, did the same thing but added journey planning, using a local SQLite database of station names and location coordinates, and an implementation of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to find an optimal route between stations. It could find the nearest station to start your journey from your location, and also added a map view which included a locally rendered overlay that showed the locations of each station on your route, along with colour coded lines highlighting which Tube, DLR or Overground line you'd need to take, and your current location for reference.

These apps were one of my earlier pet development projects and, suffice to say, not particularly good. But, they did just about function (at the time).

These apps have not been updated or available for download since 2012, and their functionality has been superceded by many better alternatives (including the transit layer built into Google Maps).

Despite these apps being unpublished and hence unavailable for almost a decade, I've recently been getting nag emails from Google asking me to provide a privacy policy for both of these apps, I guess in case anyone happens to still use an ancient device from the early 2010s that has either of these apps installed. (Turns out, Google won't allow you to delete apps that ever had any live installations. They exist forever - or at least until Google finds a solution to dealing with the growing graveyard of unpublished apps that has accumulated over the last decade).

So, for now at least, here are some privacy policies to mollify the bots over at Google.
