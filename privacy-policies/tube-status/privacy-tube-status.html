<h1 id="-tube-status-privacy-policy">&quot;Tube Status&quot; Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Tube Status (hereafter referred to as the &quot;app&quot;) was built in 2011 as a Free app, and it was retired around the same time and removed from distribution. This app was provided at no cost and was intended for use as-is.</p>
<p>This app is NO LONGER MAINTAINED and is NOT currently offered for download or distribution, either directly or via any service (including but not limited to the Google Play store).</p>
<p>This page is used for reference to inform visitors who may have used the application either in the past (or users who still have installations of the app to this day), of my policies in regard to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information - as required by Google Play.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-the-tl-dr-">What&#39;s the TL;DR?</h3>
<p>First: Congratulations on finding this page! You are probably the last active user of this app. I&#39;m sorry. Now, to business.</p>
<p>This app does not collect any personal information. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. It has the information collection and retention capacity of a brick.</p>
<p>And if it did collect any data, I have nowhere to store it. No server, no database, nothing. If someone came asking which tube route you took to work back in 2011, I would have absolutely no way of providing this information. Because it doesn&#39;t exist. Because I didn&#39;t collect it in the first place.</p>
<p>Also, the app no longer exists on the Play Store, and hasn&#39;t for over a decade, so there&#39;s that.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-i-enjoy-reading-long-documents-and-or-legalese-">What if I enjoy reading long documents and/or legalese?</h3>
<p>Then please continue reading. I didn&#39;t <del>plagiarize</del> write this document for fun, you know.</p>
