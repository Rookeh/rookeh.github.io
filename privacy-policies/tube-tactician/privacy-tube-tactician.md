# "Tube Tactician" Privacy Policy

Rookeh built Tube Tactician (hereafter referred to as the "app") in 2011 as a Free app, and it was retired in 2012 and removed from distribution at that time. This app was provided by Rookeh at no cost and was intended for use as-is.

This app is NO LONGER MAINTAINED and is NOT currently offered for download or distribution, either directly or via any service (including but not limited to the Google Play store).

This page is used for reference to inform visitors who may have used the application either in the past (or users who still have installations of the app to this day), of my policies in regard to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information - as required by Google Play.

### What's the TL;DR?

First: Congratulations on finding this page! You are probably the last active user of this app. I'm sorry. Now, to business.

I don't transmit or store personal data from this app, period. I physically can't. I have nowhere to store it. No server, no database, nothing. If someone came asking which tube route you took to work back in 2012, I would have absolutely no way of providing this information. Because it doesn't exist. Because I didn't collect it in the first place.

Also, the app no longer exists on the Play Store, and hasn't for nearly a decade, so there's that.

### What if I enjoy reading long documents and/or legalese?

Then please continue reading. I didn't ~~plagiarize~~ write this document for fun, you know.

## Information Collection and Use

In order for the app to provide certain functionality, it requires access to user location data. This is the only personally identifiable information ever requested or processed directly by the application, and is held in device memory only. It is not collected or transmitted directly by the app to any server or external system.

The app was designed to function equally well in an online or offline environment with no cellular service, and thus does not rely on any external servers or services for its core functionality (route planning).

It is however possible for the app to make requests to some external services when available, in order to provide a better user experience. The third party services used by the app, and their purposes, are as follows:

* Google Play Services, 
	* In order to display mapping data for the area surrounding the user's route via the Google Maps API. The location of the user is not explicitly delivered to the service, and graphics highlighting the location of the user, their route and location of stations and interchanges, are all rendered locally on the device.
* Transport for London
	* To provide service updates for routes requested by the user.

## Log Data

Whenever the application was used, and specifically in the case of an error occurring in the app, data and information may have been collected through Google Play services from your device. This Log Data may have included information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing the app, the time and date of your use of the app, and other statistics. This log data is collected by Google Play services if you opted-in to sharing this information from your device. These crash logs are not otherwise collected or stored by any means or process other than that offered via Google Play. For more information please refer to the Google Play services privacy policy linked above.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This app does not use cookies explicitly. However, the dependencies of the app (including but not limited to: third party libraries and APIs) may require the use of cookies in order to collect information and improve their services.

## Security

Although location data is not transmitted off your device by the app, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This app may contain links to other sites, or data provided by other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children’s Privacy

The app does not directly address anyone under the age of 13. The app does not collect or transmit personally identifiable information from *anyone*, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

In the extremely unlikely event I ever update this Privacy Policy, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2021-10-29, although the behaviour outlined above has not changed since the time of last publication of the app.
